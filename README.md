jsNumberFormatter
=================

Number formatting library - Pure stand-alone javascript

This is intended to be the basis of my rewrite of the jQuery plugin jQuery-NumberFormatter (https://code.google.com/p/jquery-numberformatter/), providing base methods that do not require jQuery at all or any other dependency.

Purely at prototype stage right now.

Supports many parsing and formatting, including a module for locale support.

Looking fairly good now, still a bit of work to come.

Features: see the jQuery plugin, I will be adding many more also.
